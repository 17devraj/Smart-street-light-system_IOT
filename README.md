Smart Street Light System (IoT)
An intelligent street lighting system designed to optimize energy consumption by dynamically adjusting light intensity based on environmental conditions and motion detection. Developed as part of an academic project, this system utilizes IoT technologies to enhance urban infrastructure efficiency.

🌟 Features
Motion Detection: Lights activate upon detecting movement, ensuring illumination only when necessary.

Ambient Light Sensing: Adjusts brightness based on surrounding light conditions to conserve energy.

Automated Control: Eliminates the need for manual intervention by automating light operations.

User Interface: Provides a frontend interface for monitoring and control.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Hardware: Arduino microcontroller, IR sensors, LDRs, LEDs.

Software: C++ (Arduino IDE) for embedded programming.

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the user interface.
